# Vim Tricks and Tips

- Searching current word/selection
  - `*` or `#`
  - Search forward/backward for word under cursor/selection.
- Searching within range
  - `:s` after visual selection
  - Restricts the substitute command to the selection.
- Deleting Buffers
  - `:bd` or `:%bd`
  - Delete Buffer or Delete All Buffers
- Window operations (swap, resize):
  - `<C-w>{action}`
  - Useful actions are `[s]plit`, `[v]split`, `[x]change`, `=`.
  - Splits also mapped to `<C-\>` and `<C-_>`.
- Recording macros:
  - `qq{...}q` then `[count]Q`
  - Record ... into register q, then repeat last recorded register.
- Format multi-line code to single-line:
  - `V[count]{motion}J`
  - Visually select lines and Join them.
- Block indent/unindent:
  - `V[count]{motion}[count]{>|<}`
  - Visually select lines and Shift them.
- Selecting based on AST:
  - `grn` and `grm` (in visual mode)
  - Select next/previous node in AST with nvim-treesitter.
- Selecting based on textobject:
  - `v{a|i}{TextObject}`
  - Visually around/in textobject (function, parentheses, ...).
- Modifying surrounding (parentheses, quotes, ...)
  - `s{action}{input}[output]`
  - Surround with mini.surround.
- Folds (with Treesitter):
  - `z{a|A|R|M}`
  - `a` - toggle 1, `A` - toggle all, `R` - open all, `M` - close all
- See command line outputs and logging messages:
  - `:messages`
  - Mapped to `:Noice`
