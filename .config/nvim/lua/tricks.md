# Vim Tricks and Tips

- Recording macros:
  - `qq{...}q` then `[count]Q`
  - Record ... into register q, then repeat last recorded register.
- Format multi-line code to single-line:
  - `V[count]{motion}J`
  - Visually select lines and Join them.
- Block indent/unindent:
  - `V[count]{motion}[count]{>|<}`
  - Visually select lines and Shift them.
- Selecting based on AST:
  - `grn` and `grm` (in visual mode)
  - Select next/previous node in AST with nvim-treesitter.
- Selecting based on textobject:
  - `v{a|i}{TextObject}`
  - Visually around/in textobject (function, parentheses, ...).
- Modifying surrounding (parentheses, quotes, ...)
  - `s{action}{input}[output]`
  - Surround with mini.surround.
- Window operations (swap, resize)
  - `<C-w>{action}`
  - Useful actions are `[s]plit`, `[v]split`, `[x]change`, bind to other keys.
